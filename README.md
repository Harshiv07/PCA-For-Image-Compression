# Principal Component Analysis of a 32x32 grayscale image for image compression

### Technology used: Verilog, Matlab programming language, FPGA Zynq, Floating Point Unit.
### Software used: ISE Design suit 14.7, Matlab 2018a(With HDL coder).
### Summary: 
We made a Matlab program which can find EigenValues and EigenVectors of 'n' dimensional
grayscale image. After that, we have to implement that in Hardware Descriptive language Verilog and then dump the code on FPGA.
Learning Outcomes: We learnt how an image is compressed.
